  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

Skills I've learned:
-the coding work flow where I edit the code in the text editor then refresh the page in the web broweser
-the basics of HTML
-how to use resources on the internet for when I get stuck (MDN, Google, StackOverflow, W3Schools)

What has been easy:
-Most of HTML has opening and closing tags so once I know what a tag is used for, the formatting of the rest of the page is pretty straightforward
-The HTML package for sublime color-codes html files. The color-coding helps to debug when something isn't working because it is easy to see where there is something wrong.

What has been difficult:
-It is taking time to adjust to the fact that the way I format the text in the html file will not be the same way it shows up in the browswer. A line break in the html file will only show up if I use <br> instead of making one like on a normal text file. 
-understanding when to use <b> vs <strong> and <i> vs <em>

How I've used the problem solving strategies from the first project:
-I knew that I had resources available to look into for when I got stuck
-I used MDN, Google, StackOverflow, W3Schools
-I took time and stepped away to get refreshed
